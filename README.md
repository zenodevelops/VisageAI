## Overview

Visage AI uses the power of [face-api.js](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js) to detect, recognize, and analyze faces in real time or via uploaded images.
---

## Features

- **Real-Time Camera Feed**: Detects and displays faces on live video.
- **Face Recognition**: Saves faces with names for quick identification.
- **Expression Analysis**: Identifies and labels facial expressions (e.g., happy, sad, surprised).
- **Upload & Detect**: Recognizes faces from uploaded images.
- **Alert Mode**: Logs known faces in a dedicated panel and highlights recognized individuals in red.

---

## Project Structure
- **index.html** loads all resources and defines the DOM structure.  
- **style.css** contains custom styling for the matrix effect, retro UI, and layout.  
- **script.js** incorporates the face detection logic, UI interactions, and matrix animation.  
- **models** stores the pretrained Face API model files for detection, landmarks, recognition, and expression analysis.

## Usage

### Real-Time Camera Detection
- When prompted, allow **Camera Access** to enable the live video feed.  
- The webcam feed will appear on the screen, and any detected faces will be outlined with green bounding boxes.

### Saving Faces
1. Click the **Save Face** button in the Control Center.  
2. A pop-up dialog will appear with a preview of the detected face and an input field to assign a name.  
3. Once saved, the face will be added to the **Saved Faces** list.

### Uploading Images
1. Click the **Upload Image** button in the **Saved Faces** section.  
2. Select an image from your computer containing one or more faces.  
3. If a face is detected, youâ€™ll be prompted to save it with a name. The saved face will be stored for future recognition.

### Expression Toggle
- Enable the **Show Expression** checkbox in the Control Center to display detected facial expressions (e.g., happy, sad, surprised) and facial landmarks over the live video feed.

### Alert Mode
1. Enable the **Alert Mode** checkbox in the Control Center.  
2. Faces that have been previously saved will be logged in the **Logs** section with timestamps when recognized.  
3. Recognized faces will also have their bounding boxes highlighted in red.

### Logs
- The **Logs** panel displays a list of recognized faces along with timestamps.  
- Use the **Clear Logs** button to clear the history.
